Dino Game Automatic Jumping with Arduino

This project automates the Dino game in Google Chrome by making the dinosaur jump using an Arduino circuit and C++ code.

Overviewü§ñ

Objective: Automatically trigger jumps in the Dino game using an Arduino.

How It Works: Arduino detects obstacles (like cacti) and simulates a jump in real-time.

Tools Used‚öôÔ∏è

Arduino: Controls the jump action.

C++: Handles the logic for obstacle detection and jump trigger.

Google Chrome Dino Game: The game the Dino interacts with.

Features‚ú®

Automatic jumping based on in-game obstacles.

No game modification, works with the regular Dino game.

Componentsü§ñ

Arduino Uno (or compatible board)

Jumper wires, buttons, resistors, and sensors (for obstacle detection)

A computer with Google Chrome

SetupüöÄ

Build the Circuit: Connect buttons/sensors to the Arduino.

Upload Code: Use the Arduino IDE to upload C++ code that detects obstacles and triggers jumps.

Running the Projectüíª

Build the circuit and connect the Arduino via USB.

Open the Dino game.

Test the automatic jump functionality.
